## About me
Hi! I'm a programmer analyst from Lima, Peru.

I started this adventure three years ago in Quebec, Canada, and since then, I haven't stopped exploring and learning about the world of development and technology.  
Currently, I'm focused on improving my backend skills, working with technologies like Ruby on Rails and Laravel.

I enjoy building robust web applications, learning new tools, and collaborating with diverse teams. I'm always open to new ideas, challenges, and opportunities!
